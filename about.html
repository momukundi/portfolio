            <p>When creating worthwhile products and solutions, you need someone you can depend on, someone whose <span class="secondary-text">quality</span> of work you trust in.
              My aim is to craft memorable software that <span class="secondary-text">impacts</span> its users. To that end, I combine personal  <span class="secondary-text">responsibility and innovation</span> and
              align them with the collaboration, teamwork, and vision of results-driven decision makers and creatives.</p>

            <h3 class="card-text">Diligent</h3>
            <p>Diligence helps us to be thorough, it's what keeps us going and adds variety to the mundane. Through it, we make better decisions. It's that thing that's just not right but you can't
              yet point it out so you pull apart your code or call on trusty dev tools. It's been known to help in finding bugs. It keeps me unsatisfied until my best work is done. It's what comes naturally.

            <h3 class="card-text">Adaptable</h3>
            <p>If most of our methodology serves to accomplish a goal or task, shouldn't we then consider what works in the best interest of the goal and not of the method? However, not every reason drives adaptability neither should it go unchecked
              nor unbounded. It's my experience that when one chooses to be adaptable, they benefit a great deal. So, having considered various reasons, available options, and methodologies why not chose what works well?</p>

            <h3 class="card-text">Thoughtful</h3>
            <p>Often things are not always that easy. It would be understandable to only look after our own needs and concerns. However,
              there's a way to make it easier for ourselves and for others, one such way is by caring about those we meet or work with. This does not take
              more than we are capable of giving. We may not quantify the benefit of caring or measure its output but we don't need to - we feel the difference in our hearts. </p>
